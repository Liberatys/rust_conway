# Conway's Game of Life in Rust (with ggez)

I wanted to implement a little project to find out how [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) 
works and how well it compares to other game engines for rust.

So I implement a version of Conway's game of life that uses ggez
to render the pixels to a dialog screen.
